TODO items for greater generality

- parsers.php still has an explicit year in it

- See the customization instructions in README-Calendar.md; need decide how to move PHP config into .js

- Can/should samples.php take date date from access.php and/or database? e.g. define a "html_for_date_buttons(..)"
