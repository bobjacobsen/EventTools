# EventTools - software for model railroad convention web sites

EventTools provides the back-end engine for managing the op sessions, clinics and tours at a model railroad convention or operations meet. It's been used by the [X2011 West](http://x2011west.org) NMRA national convention, and several regional [operations meets](http://bayrails.org).

This is the primary software distribution directory.

For more information, see the [overview](https://github.com/bobjacobsen/EventTools/blob/master/eventtools/EventTools.pdf) as a starting point, followed by the [admin manual](https://github.com/bobjacobsen/EventTools/blob/master/eventtools/EventToolsAdmin.pdf).

EventTools is licensed under the GPL version 2.  We're quite serious about that.
