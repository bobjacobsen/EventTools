In this clinic, long-time Sierra fan and modeler Glenn Sutherland will demonstrate that this is just as true for the railroad''s Angels Branch as it is for the Sierra as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Railway was built in 1897 to connect the gold mines and lumber mills of Tuolumne County, CA with the outside world.  Shortly thereafter, the railroad built its 19-mile Angels Branch to reach the neighboring town of Angels Camp and the freight potential of the numerous gold mines operating in the area.  From 1902 to 1939, the quaint and picturesque Angels Branch used unique equipment to haul heavy loads up and down steep grades, across a major river, and through 4 switchbacks.\r\n\r\nAfter a very brief overview of the entire Sierra Railway, Glenn will describe and show historic photos of the Angels Branch and its colorful history.  Then Glenn will describe how to model the branch, including its signature scenes, key structures, unique equipment, and operating practices. He will show examples from his own HO scale prototype-based Sierra Railway layout (circa 1923), which includes a 160'' long depiction of the Angels Branch.', 0, '', 'Glenn Sutherland', 2, '', 'glennsutherland@sti.net', NULL, 'Y', '209-769-7255', 'None', 'None', 'mywindows', '', NULL);

Muni, as it is affectionately called locally, operates a rotating twenty of the forty plus trolleys in regular service on a dedicated line that runs from Fisherman''s Wharf along the waterfront past the famous Ferry Terminal and then along Market Street through the city''s Financial District to the end of the line in what is known as the Castro District.

Being a small railway, locomotives, cars, buildings, industries, and structures are necessarily small and compact. Freight cars are four and eight wheel ore cars, quarry cars, and general freight cars. Passenger business is handled by combines run as mixed trains and a railbus. The railway also runs periodic excursion trains for special occasions. There is also a small excursion railway running through a botanical garden.\r\n<p>Built in FN3 Scale, with about 350 feet of track, the railway uses both live steam and onboard battery powered locomotives, radio controlled. The battery powered locomotives and a railbus also have electronic sound. Track is Llagas Creek code 215 rail, ties, and switches laid on granite "dust" ballast.\r\n<p>As a Garden Railway, most of the railway is outside. There is a town, a saw mill, locomotive facilities, some "whistle stops", and a small stream running to a dam with two gold mines and a quarry on a switchback. Grades on the railway are up to 8%. Trees are "in scale", living Dwarf Alberta Spruce, Cypress, and Rosemary, as well as verbena, and several ground covers.\r\nEarl has enjoyed model railroading for more than sixty five years, always modeling small, believable railways that "might have been".  So like real railways, the TVNG has a past.  It evolved from his Thunder Valley Tram begun about 50 years ago. The Tram (although On20 Scale at that time) began as a small back woods railway and very narrow gauge (20 inch), serving mines and a small community. As business got better and loads got heavier, tracks were widened to ON3 and eventually evolved into the Fn3 Thunder Valley Narrow Gauge Railway of today. \r\n\r\n', 'Fn3', '', '', '', '350 feet Garden Railway', '', '', '', 'Live Steam and Onboard Battery', 4, 'N', 'N', '', 'Earl and Jody', 'Martin', '(916) 773-0933', '', '', '4019 Pine Cabin Way', 'Roseville', 'CA', '', '', 62, 'Unknown', 'Unknown', 'Unknown', 'Unknown', 'Unknown', 'Unknown', 'Unknown', 'N/A', 'Unknown', '', '', NULL),
