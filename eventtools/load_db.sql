It also provided these mines with needed lumber, mining timbers and cord wood for fuel. It ultimately extended from Virginia City to Reno via Carson City. However the decline of the Comstock mines near Virginia City forced the railroad to make its last run in May 1950.\r\n<p/>\r\nBut the V&amp;T was not forgotten. In the mid-1970s, Robert Gray began rebuilding the V&amp;T from Virginia City through Tunnel 4 to Gold Hill, a few miles away, as a tourist line. Steam trains began running over this portion of the historic line in 1976.  In 2005, work began on reconstruction of the line between Virginia City and Carson City and the inaugural run over the new line, much of which follows the original alignment, took place in August 2009.   \r\n<p/>\r\nWe will ride the reconstructed V&T from Carson City to historic Virginia City where you will have an opportunity to sightsee the old town as well as enjoy an own your own lunch.
